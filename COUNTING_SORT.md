# COUNTING SORT

Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that operates by counting the distinct elements in an array, then calculating the prefix sum of the count array to determine the position of each element in the sorted output array. It doesn't make any comparison between the elements, which is its biggest difference from comparison based algorithms like quick sort.

The main benefit of counting sort is its efficiency. It runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements. This makes it faster than comparison-based algorithms such as quick sort, which operate in O(n log n) time in their best and average cases, and O(n^2) in the worst case.

However, counting sort has a few important limitations:

It can only be used for sorting elements that are non-negative integers or objects that can be converted into non-negative integers. This is because it relies on the values of elements as indexes into an array.

It's not an in-place sorting algorithm. It needs extra space to store the count array and the output array. The space complexity of counting sort is O(n + k), where n is the number of elements and k is the range of input elements.

It's not a stable sorting algorithm in its basic form, although it can be made stable.

Now, let's discuss the specifics of your implementation.

For integers, your code first finds the maximum score to initialize the count array. Then it counts the occurrence of each score, calculates the prefix sum of the count array, and uses this information to place each university in the correct position in the output array.

For strings, your code first finds the maximum length of strings. Then it sorts the strings by each character position from right to left. For each position, it counts the occurrence of each ASCII character, calculates the prefix sum of the count array, and uses this information to place each university in the correct position in the output array.

Compared to quick sort, your counting sort implementation is likely faster when sorting integers if the range of scores is not very large. For sorting strings, the performance will depend on the length and distribution of strings. If the strings are short and/or there are many repeated strings, counting sort could be faster. However, if the strings are long and/or there are many distinct strings, quick sort could be faster. This is because the time complexity of your string sorting code is O(n \* m), where n is the number of universities and m is the maximum length of strings.

Also note that quick sort is a comparison-based algorithm and can sort any type of elements, while counting sort has limitations as mentioned above. Quick sort is also an in-place algorithm and uses less space than counting sort.

In summary, counting sort is a useful algorithm when you're dealing with non-negative integers or objects that can be converted into non-negative integers, and when you care more about time complexity than space complexity. However, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution and may not be the best choice in some scenarios.
